This chatbot application is designed with a modern tech stack. The frontend is built using ReactJS and the backend with Flask, a lightweight Python web framework.  
The chatbot was initially trained using the "difflib" Python library, which allows it to perform basic text matching and response generation. This setup provides a solid foundation for the chatbot's capabilities.  
However, the current operation of the chatbot is built on Command R, a generational LLM built by Cohere; it significantly enhances the chatbot's conversational abilities, enabling it to understand and respond to a wider array of queries with greater accuracy and context.

The Python backend libraries used in this project:

- flask, flask_jwt_extended, flask_CORS, flask_bcrypt

- datetime
- openpyxl
